# Basic Algorithms Implementation

This project contains implementations of basic algorithms and tasks related to them. It includes the following tasks:

1. Hash Table
2. Binary Search
3. Boyer-Moore Search Comparison

## Files

- `hash_table.py`: Contains the implementation of a hash table with insert, get, and delete methods.
- `binary_search.py`: Contains the implementation of binary search for a sorted array with fractional numbers, returning the number of iterations and the upper bound.
- `boyer_moore.py`: Contains the implementations of the Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, and Rabin-Karp substring search algorithms and compares their efficiency.
- `main.py`: Provides a menu to select and run the tasks.
- `readme.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the required text files (`article1.txt` and `article2.txt`) in the same directory as the scripts.
3. Run the `main.py` script to access the menu and select a task to run.

### Running the `main.py`

To start the program, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
python main.py
